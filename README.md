# Real_Estate_DB_design
The domain of our relational database application is real estate transaction records on a listing website. We have implemented add and remove buyers, check realtor/property information with different criteria, as well as add and update property tax/assessment for a specific year.


There are 5 files:
- realEstate_DDL_INSERT.sql that creates all tables and define the schema in database
- SS_populate.sql that populate data to the database
- realEstateQueries.sql that contains some manipulating query examples
- real-estate.php that define the user interface of our application
